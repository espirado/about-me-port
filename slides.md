#  Espira Andrew


 My first encounter with a computer was in 2004,while still in class 4 during our computer classes. Over the years i fell in love with the machines but was not interested in pursuing a career in computing. I wanted to be a pilot(dream job).I joined campus to pursue electrical engineering but in my first two weeks,i dropped the course then embarked on a journey of self discovery. I took up computer technology and over the years,this has been one of the many choices in life that has really paid off.

# Work Experience

Programming was one of the few things that facinated my curiosity. The moment i wrote my first program in c++,my journey to software development started. Most of my campus years i spent building applications for companies and being involved in tech communities. 


  #  Data Engineering/ML/AI

   My first job was as a data engineer in a small startup in Nairobi. I was in my final year in campus and really pursuing a AI/ML experience in real life. I got an entry job that saw me gain quite alot of technical hands on experience 

  -  Assembled large, complex data sets that meet functional / non-functional business requirements.
  -  Identified, designed, and implemented internal process improvements: automating manual processes, optimizing data delivery, redesigning infrastructure for greater scalability
  - Build the infrastructure required for optimal extraction, transformation, and loading of data from a wide variety of data sources using SQL
  - Build analytics tools that utilize the data pipeline to provide actionable insights into customer acquisition,operational efficiency and other key business performance metrics.
  - Worked with stakeholders including the Executive, Product, Data and Design teams to assist with data- related technical issues and support their data infrastructure needs
  - Worked with data and analytics experts to strive for greater functionality in our data systems.

#  System Engineering/System Administration/Linux systems 

  - Implemented high performance platform by integrating cluster nodes of Linux server using distributed computing models

  - Reduced analyis time by implementing high performace computing for big data and research data
      computations by boosting processing time through cpu optimizations and job managements

  - Automated data piplelines and softwares deployment by building docker images and data      pipelines for common workflows which increased data processing time

  - Offered management and system recommendation on management of high-performance computer
      systems, clusters, operating systems, peripherals, and system interfaces; monitors system usage;ensures that the high-performance computing complex is operating at optimal performance and reliability levels
      
  -  Designed and implemented server architectures on parallel computing platform to efficient manage jobs,file storages and users using job manager tool(SLURM) and IPA(identity management Framework)

  - Identified security vulnerabilities and implemented procedures to ensure data center met all security requirements by analyzing system logs and network logs

#  DevOPs,SRE and Cloud computing
   - Designed and built systems and infrastructure with guiding principles of high AWS well architecture framework and implementing system architectures that improve our operation
   efficiency

   - Developed and implemented software release management strategies for various applications according to agile process and continuous delivery practices Using Gitops operations to deploy
    and manage Kubernetes

  - Increased Continuous Intergrations using GitHub Developed and implemented software release management strategies for various applications according to agile process

  - Worked on improving securing, building reliable systems, and deploying multiple applications on AWS by taking advantage of services like AWS amplify, ec2, s3, Elb, route53, CloudWatch,
   CloudFormation etc.

  -  Improved application performance by in cooperating micro-services instrumenting and tracing to enhance our observability and monitoring on our services

  - Using APM tools to advance and implement Service level objectives and monitoring service levels indicators and error budgets to offer our customers reliable and available services
  - Improved code quality by introducing automated testing, code review, coding standards and following best practices as per the company policies on quality code.

  - Team management building activities, training developers on best practices in DeVops and Sre and introducing new tools and technology to better their development experience through
    weekly tech updates and displays.
